    ZSHARE v1.0  --  Weapon sharing for Black Ops II Zombies
    Plutonium T6

    by Xep

======================================================================

    Everything you can hand a teammate, all from the button you buy
    everything else with:

        Weapons   Look at a teammate and press use. They see the gun in
                  your hands, look back at you and press use, and the
                  two weapons change hands -- ammo, Pack-a-Punch,
                  attachments and camo travel with them.
        Points    Crouch first, then use: 1000 points go across.
        Box hits  Paid for a box weapon you do not want? Crouch and
                  press use at the box, and it is anyone's to take. The
                  same at the Pack-a-Punch machine.
        Paying    Crouch and press use at a perk machine, or at the box
                  or the Pack-a-Punch while nobody is using it, and the
                  next teammate to use that machine pays nothing.

    There is nothing new to learn. Use is the button, crouching is what
    changes what it does, and the prompt on screen says which.

    Everything runs on the host. Nobody else needs this file or any mod:
    the prompts, the swap, the box, the machines and the points all
    execute server-side and replicate to stock clients.

    Settings live in zs_load_config() below. Each one is also a dvar of
    the same name, and the config is re-read every few seconds and on
    every press, so changes apply without a map restart.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    HOW IT WORKS

    The prompts on players are the game's own use triggers. Each player
    carries one per teammate, linked to them the way _zm_laststand.gsc
    links the revive prompt to a downed player, so it follows them and
    only lights up when that teammate is looking at them.

    A weapon changes hands the way the game's own weapon locker moves
    one: _zm_weapons.gsc reads everything about a weapon into a record
    with get_player_weapondata() and gives it back with weapondata_give().
    ZShare takes the two records, takes the two weapons, and gives each
    record to the other player.

    The box already knows how to let anybody take a weapon somebody else
    paid for -- box_rerespun, the state the hacker's re-spin leaves it in
    -- and how to open for nothing: auto_open and no_charge, the state
    the hacker's summon leaves it in. Sharing a hit sets the first.
    Paying for a spin sets the second.

    The Pack-a-Punch reads its price off its trigger on every press, so
    a paid pack is that price held at zero until somebody uses it. Its
    take loop is replaced with itself plus a share branch.

    A perk machine asks custom_perk_validation before it looks at the
    price, and that is where a paid drink is handed out, through the
    stock drinking code. Mob of the Dead and Origins use the same hook,
    and theirs are asked first.

    A perk machine and the Pack-a-Punch each show one prompt to every
    player, but a payer needs different words. So the payer's words are
    a second prompt at the machine, and the two stock loops that decide
    who sees a machine are replaced with copies that hide it from anyone
    reading the second one.

    PROMPTS ON PLAYERS

    One use trigger per (teammate, viewer) pair, linked to the teammate
    and visible only to the viewer. Two per pair, one each way, so four
    players carry twelve between them.

    Per pair rather than per teammate because the words on the prompt
    depend on who is reading it: "accept the trade" is only true for the
    one player the offer was made to, and "give 1000 points" only for a
    viewer who is crouched. A shared prompt could only ever say the
    generic thing.

    Every string on a prompt is one of a fixed handful. Hint strings are
    configstrings -- the same pool a HUD element's settext() draws from,
    the pool that a ticking clock drawn as text once exhausted -- so a
    weapon or player name never goes into one. Names go in the chat
    line, which is not a configstring.

    The use key is written [{+activate}], the form every localized stock
    prompt uses and the client swaps for each player's own binding. &&1
    is not it: in a stock prompt &&1 is where the cost goes.

/* ==================================================================
    THE BOX

    Every box has a unitrigger stub -- the record the game builds a
    per-player use trigger from whenever somebody comes near. Two of its
    hooks are open, and ZShare takes both:

        onspawnfunc              runs as each trigger is built, before
                                 its think thread starts. It puts our
                                 relay in as the thread, in place of the
                                 stock one that only forwards presses.
        prompt_and_visibility    decides what each player reads. Ours
                                 calls the stock one and then rewrites
                                 the words when there is something to
                                 share, to pay for, or to take.

    Because the prompt is built per player, a box never needs a second
    prompt the way a perk machine does: the payer, the player a payment
    is waiting for and everybody else can each read their own words off
    the same box.

    Sharing is one field: box_rerespun, the state the hacker's re-spin
    leaves a box in. Paying is two: auto_open and no_charge, the state the
    hacker's summon leaves it in. treasure_chest_think() then opens the
    box for the next player who presses, and charges nothing.

    A payment belongs to the box, not to where the box is. It sits on
    whichever location is live, follows the box when it moves, and waits
    out a fire sale -- a spin costs 10 then, and a free spin during one
    would count toward the box moving where a normal fire sale spin
    does not.
